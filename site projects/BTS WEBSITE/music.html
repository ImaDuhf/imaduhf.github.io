                    intro track and an edgy theme as the aimed image for the No More Dreams Era. The caption read

                    album. In 2013, the extended play was ranked fifty-fifth on Gaon's year end chart.<br><br>

                    On August 27, 2013, following the release of their debut album 2 Cool 4 Skool, another countdown
                    clock was launched on their official website along with a comeback trailer on YouTube to prepare and
                    promote their next comeback, O! RUL8, 2?. On August 29, 2013, the track list and concept photos for
                    the album were uploaded onto their official Twitter account and Facebook page. On their official
                    shop website, the design and details of the physical album was also revealed. On September 4, 2013,
                    Big Hit Entertainment released a concept trailer and a teaser for the title track N.O one day later.
                    On September 8, 2013, an audio preview was dropped.<br><br>

                    Their first comeback show for O!RUL8, 2? was on September 12, 2013 on Mnet's M Countdown which was
                    then followed by performances on KBS's Music Bank, MBC's Music Core, SBS's Inkigayo and Arirang TV's
                    Simply K-Pop, In November 2013, the album was further promoted with The Rise of Bangtan on music
                    programs.<br><br>

                    O!RUL8, 2? debuted at #4 on the Gaon Weekly Album Chart in the 2nd week of September 2013 and at #11
                    on the September Gaon Album Monthly Chart. It was on the Gaon Album Yearly Chart from 2013-2016 with
                    a peak position at #55 in 2013, #92 in 2014, #87 in 2015, and #85 in 2016.<br><br>

                    The Rap line (RM, J-Hope, SUGA) actually had 2 tracks in this, one being their first cypher and the
                    other being Satoori Rap aka Paldogangsan which was actually the first song to bear the stamp “BTS”
                    (includes members who would later become official members of the group) and released on August 17,
                    2011 to announce Big Hit's Hit It Audition.<br><br>
                    The album spoke out mostly for the youth who are forced to live their lives the way others,
                    especially adults, expect and try to control us to and called the youth to stand up for ourselves
                    and begin living the way we want to before it was too late since the way we live will eventually
                    become the person we are. They're trying to wake up those who haven't realized what were actually
                    being done to them as they continue to live the same identical lives with their parents and teachers
                    always putting pressure on them to do better and give them what they expect them to. BTS points out
                    how it has always been about other's standards and finding the best possible ways to please them,
                    but never about the happiness of those actually are doing the work.<br><br>

                    BTS also discusses their music careers and how they will keep rising and growing to be the best
                    artists they can and show their antis how they will still rule the world despite their hate and
                    opposition.<br><br>
